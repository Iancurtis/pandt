# Phone-and-Tablet Roleplaying Game

This is a project to implement a from-scratch tabletop roleplaying game that
uses electronic modeling for (almost) all game simulation.


# Brainstorm

First, get a multiplayer map working
- players move their tokens
- GM vets each move
- GM moves NPC tokens


Then add abilities.
- player picks ability, picks target

Then make it fun, assuming no progression system
Then add a progression system.


Also, how about... not having a map?
