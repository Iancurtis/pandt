# P&T

P&T is a social role-playing game. It's not a video game -- rather, it's akin to tabletop
role-playing games like Dungeons & Dragons, but instead of needing books and character sheets, the
app takes care of everything for you. It provides a tactical combat map and makes it easy for
players and the Game Master to use their abilities.
